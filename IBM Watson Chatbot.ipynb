Go ahead, select our three chitchat intents and click on the Export button to download a CSV file containing our intents and examples. Open the file to see what it looks like.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, it's very easy to create, modify, and delete intents, whether they were manually created or imported from the Content Catalog.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exercise 2: Import intents from a CSV file\n",
    "Just like we exported our intents to a CSV file, we can do the opposite and import intents from a CSV file. This format is particularly handy because it allows you to easily import intents (and their examples) from a spreadsheet. Let's see how this works in practice.\n",

    "\n",
    "In our fictitious Flower Shop Chain, we have stores in Toronto, Montreal, Calgary, and Vancouver. So when a user asks, Where is your Toronto store? we shouldn't ignore that extra bit of information so that we can take the location into account when formulating a response.\n",

Nearby small cities and towns can also act as synonyms. After all, if people are asking about your store in a nearby town, they might be happy with an answer for the nearest city.\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, a synonym is not necessarily the dictionary definition of synonym. Though those are good candidates for synonyms as well when the context makes sense. For example, we could have an entity called @relationship and the entity value @relationship:mother with mom as a synonym for that value. When the user enters a question including the word mom, Watson will detect @relationship:mother (the entity value for that synonym).\n",

    "\n",
    "We have three chit chat intents, #greetings, #thank_you, and #goodbyes. We now need to have nodes that specify what response we want to give the user when such intents are detected.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a couple of strategies possible here. We could create three nodes, one for each of these intents. This is the most common and simple approach. The other option would be to create a single node for chit chat that uses multiple responses (essentially, conditional responses), attaching a condition to each response.\n",
    "\n",
    "I would recommend that you stick to the traditional way as it's more flexible. It allows us to add more chit chat nodes down the line, as well as making the chit chat logic more complex if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to keep things organized, separating small talk from domain-specific nodes. So we'll create a folder for chit chat, and we'll create three nodes in it for now. The picture below shows the end result. At any time, you'll be able to collapse or expand the folder by clicking on the blue folder icon.\n",

    "It's worth noting that you can make the condition of a node as complex or as simple as you'd like. You can use ||(or its alias OR) and && (or its alias AND) to make the condition more complex. We don't want this here, but if you wanted to execute a node if the intent detected was either #greetings or #goodbyes we could simply type #greetings OR #goodbyes in the node condition.\n",

    "\n",
    "### DESCRIPTION\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 1: Respond to hours of operation\n",
    "\n",
    "Chit chat interactions are necessary to make our chatbot more pleasant and human-like. However, what makes the chatbot actually useful is its ability to answer domain-specific questions. That is business-related questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We defined intents for people inquiring about hours of operation and addresses of our fictional florist chain and even created an entity to be able to provide location-specific answers. However, much like the chit chat intents, intents alone don't offer responses to customers. We'll need to create nodes to handle these two business-specific intents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create the parent node\n",
    "We'll start by creating a node for hours of operation. Follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Select the Welcome node and click on Add node. This will create an empty node just below the first node in the dialog.\n",
    "Set the node name to Hours of Operation and use #hours_info for the node condition. This will ensure that the node will be executed when the user is inquiring about shop hours.\n",
    "In the response, enter:\n",
    "\n",
    "Our hours of operations are listed on <a href=\"https://example.org/hours/\">our Hours page</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how HTML code is allowed in responses, enabling us to provide more interactive and useful textual answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, head over to the Try it out panel and test that it works by asking:\n",
    "\n",
    "When is your Vancouver store open?\n",
    "\n",
    "as shown in the image below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://cfs22.simplicdn.net/paperclip/project/images/1561118375_17.png\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "This works and it provides a somewhat useful answer to the user (assuming we are pointing them to a page with the right information listed). However, it feels... not very smart.\n",
    "\n",
    "After all, the user asked us about a specific location. We even detected it with the @location entity (as well as the system entity) and then proceeded to ignore it, opting instead for a generic answer. We can do better than that. (Close the Try it out panel to gain some breathing room as we work on the dialog.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to handle this case properly, we'll have to consider three possible scenarios. One in which a location is specified and it's one of our locations, a second one in which the city is specified but we don't have a location, and a third one in which the user just asks about hours of operation in general without indicating a city.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a classic use case for child nodes. We'll use our current node to capture the hours of operation request, and then jump to the child nodes to decide how to handle the request on the basis of the specific location information that was or wasn't provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the way, as the complexity of your dialog grows, you might have a hard time finding which node executed the response you're seeing during troubleshooting. To help you out, you can click on the map pin icon next to the response, and the current node will be highlighted for you.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Create the Our Locations child node\n",
    "\n",
    "Delete the response from our Hours of Operation node by clicking on the trash bin icon in the Then respond with: section. We do that because we don't want this parent node to provide the answer. We'll let the child nodes decide what's the right response.\n",
    "With the Hours of Operation node selected, click on Add child node. This creates the first child node. We'll use it for the case of the user providing us a city for which we have a flower shop. So go ahead and name it Our Locations.\n",
    "Set the condition to @location, as we want to execute this node only if the user is inquiring about hours of operation for one of our locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a reminder, a child node is only executed if the parent node's condition is true or if it's jumped to from elsewhere. This means that if we are executing this child node, two conditions will actually be true as far as the user input is concerned: 1) The intent will be #hours_info; 2) The input will contain the @location entity. Knowing this allows us to provide very specific responses.\n",
    "We need a way to offer a different response for each city, so we need to enable Multiple conditioned responses. To do so, click on the Customize link within our child node. Switch on Multiple conditioned responses and click Apply. You'll notice that now we have the ability to attach a condition to each response, as shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://cfs22.simplicdn.net/paperclip/project/images/1561118452_19.png\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth noting that if the hours of operations where the same for all locations, we could have saved the trouble of switching to multiple responses and simply included @location in our response. (e.g., Our @location store is open Monday to Saturday from 9 am until 6 pm, except statutory holidays.) \n",
    "\n",
    "This would automatically output the detected entity value back to the user in the response. So when enquiring about Calgary, the user would receive the response Our Calgary store is open Monday to Saturday from 9 am until 6 pm, except statutory holidays. Of course, if stores have different hours of operation, we need to opt for the multiple response approach like we did here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create the No Such Location child node\n",
    "Now that we have a child node capable of handling hours of operation for our particular locations, we can focus on the case in which a user provides a city (detected through @sys-location), but we don't have a store in that city.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the Our Locations node selected, click the Add node button to add a peer/sibling node below it.\n",
    "Call this node No Such Location and add @sys-location as the condition.\n",
    "In the text response, enter:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Exercise 2 - Generate a WordPress website\n",
    "You followed along and now have a simple Flower Shop chatbot running in your Watson Assistant service. That's great, but how do we place it on an actual site?\n",
